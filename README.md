# Interactingbouncingballs
Java-script project, balls bounce around the screen, when the mouse is placed somewhere on the screen, the balls in that area grow quickly, then when out of that area begin to shrink back original size.


To play this project, download both files (canvas.js and open.html), then put them in the same folder and open 'open' with google.

Move your mouse around the screen and resize the screen to see how the bouncing balls interact.
